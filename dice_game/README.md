dice_game is a program that runs that game Craps. In Craps, the player bets
an inital amount, then rolls a die. If they initally roll a 7 or 11, they win.
If they initially run a 2, 3, or 12, they lose. If they roll another number,
they must reroll that number before rolling 7 to win.

To run the program, run the main.py file.
